            <h2>Hello.</h2>

My background in the automotive industry includes vehicle inspection, remarketing, working with and at auctions, title work, floor plan auditing, operations, recon management, vendor management and parts sourcing.

                <h3>Vehicle Inspection</h3>
                <p>I started inspecting vehicles when I was 27 because it was a new skill that I wanted to learn. Over time, I have become a proficient inspector from the wealth of knowledge that I gaine from the industry.</p>

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>Computer programming has always been an interest of mine as I was always fascinated in how different programs work and function. I started to learn about it during my tenure at Texas Tech and have continued to expand my knowledge by learning different languages.</p>

                <h3>Working on classic cars</h3>
                <p>One of my favorite hobbies is working on classic cars. I have a 1979 Trans Am that I am rebuilding. Working on it lets me learn constantly even if the process of the rebuild is slow</p>
